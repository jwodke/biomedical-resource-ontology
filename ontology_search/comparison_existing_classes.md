| Structured Resource | Structured Knowledge Resource | The Drug-Drug Interactions Ontology | A resource that provides access to collection of data records arranged according to some semantic framework. The semantic framework may be minimally expressive - such as a simple controlled vocabulary - or highly expressive such as a formally structured ontology. Such resources may include only a representation of universal/classes/categories or may be linked to individual instance data typed according to a set of asserted classes (i.e., a knowledgebase). | [Link](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DINTO/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fbioontology.org%2Fontologies%2FBiomedicalResourceOntology.owl%23Structured_Knowledge_Resource)
