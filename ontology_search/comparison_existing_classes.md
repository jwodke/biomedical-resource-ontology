| Structured Resource | Structured Knowledge Resource | The Drug-Drug Interactions Ontology | A resource that provides access to collection of data records arranged according to some semantic framework. The semantic framework may be minimally expressive - such as a simple controlled vocabulary - or highly expressive such as a formally structured ontology. Such resources may include only a representation of universal/classes/categories or may be linked to individual instance data typed according to a set of asserted classes (i.e., a knowledgebase). | [Link](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DINTO/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fbioontology.org%2Fontologies%2FBiomedicalResourceOntology.owl%23Structured_Knowledge_Resource)

| Computational Model |
| Structured File | Structured Data | National Cancer Institute Thesaurus | Structured health record information is divided into discrete fields, and may be enumerated, numeric, or codified. examples of structured health information include: patient address (non-codified, but discrete field); diastolic blood pressure (numeric); coded result observation; coded diagnosis; patient risk assessment questionnaire with multiple-choice answers. Context may determine whether or not data are unstructured, e.g., a progress note might be standardized and structured in some eHR-s (e.g., subjective/objective/ assessment/Plan) but unstructured in others.
